# Sky Health Check

**Sky Health Check** is a group coursework project built as part of the Software Development module led by Aleka Psarrou. It is a Django-based web application that allows users to select teams and cards, manage selections, and view selected items with an interactive user interface. This project demonstrates collaborative software development, applying Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles, testing, and security considerations.

## Project Overview

Sky Health Check is a multi-page web application developed collaboratively by a team, with each member responsible for three pages. I contributed as the **team leader** by developing key functionalities including:

- **Select Card/Team Page**: Users can select cards or teams with dynamic filtering.
- **Team Selection Page**: Manage user selections of multiple cards/teams.
- **View Selected Cards Page**: Display and interact with selected cards.

The app incorporates Django for the backend, along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, following best practices in software design, testing, and version control.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.11 and Django 4.0
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- SQLite for database management
- Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration

## Learning Outcomes Covered

This project satisfies several learning objectives, including:

- Following distinct software development phases and applying HCI principles for clear, maintainable code.
- Applying testing methods to evaluate software performance.
- Evaluating and mitigating security risks in software development.
- Managing ethical and legal considerations relevant to software projects.
- Effective team collaboration and version control.
